                    <p>
                        Stock records serve as an impetus for the economy of the entire country, explicit ventures, and when all is said in done it shows to what degree a specific circle of the market is created and what potential it has.
                         Working with stock lists, as an exchanging tool, is significant since it gives points of interest which different kinds of advantages need.

                        An important characteristic of assets is their high prediction. It is much easier to work with indices than with currency, commodity or stocks. 
                        This is due to the fact that in most cases a number of large companies are determined, and it is much easier to predict a separate industry than to deal with all the subtleties of a particular company. 
                        For example, the S & P 500 is calculated based on the stocks of the 500 largest firms.
