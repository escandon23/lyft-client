We shall be under no obligation to exercise any right or remedy either at all or in a manner or at a time beneficial to you. No failure by us to exercise or delay by us in exercising any of our rights under this Agreement (including any Transaction) or otherwise shall operate as a waiver of those or any other rights or remedies. No single or partial exercise of a right or remedy shall prevent further exercise of that right or remedy or the exercise of another right or remedy.</p>
                </li>
                <li>SET-OFF

For these purposes, we may ascribe a commercially reasonable value to any amount which is contingent or which for any other reason is unascertained.</p>
